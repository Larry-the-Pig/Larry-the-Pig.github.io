                The electoral college is where states, or other regions get electors, primarily based on population, and each electors chooses who's elected.<br>
                The electoral college helps smaller regions have more of a say in government than they're population would normally let them.<br>
                <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Some people think that the power to elect should be held in the people rather than a handful of electors.

            <p>
                The United States gives each state the same number of electors as they have seats in the house.<br>
                For example, Colorado has 7 seats in the House of Representatives, 2 senators, so it has 9 electoral votes.<br>
                States have a minimum of three votes to account for lower population.<br>
                The president that wins is determined by the majority of house votes.<br>
                <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Many presidents have been elected despite getting less votes than the competition because of the electoral college.

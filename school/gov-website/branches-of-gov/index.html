                The legislative branch, or congress, consists of the House of Representatives, and the Senate.<br>
                The House of Representatives has Representatives from each state based on population.<br>
                The Senate has 2 senators for each state no matter the population.<br>
                Representatives and senators are elected by the people from their state.<br>
                The House and the Senate can pass laws, and prevent each other from passing those laws.

            <p>
                The judicial branch is for courts and the supreme court.<br>
                The supreme court's job is to interpret the constitution and decide cases and controversies based on it.<br>
                The supreme court can decide that laws are unconstitutional and get them removed, creating a precedent for future government officials.<br>
                The supreme court judges are chosen by the president, and have the job for life.

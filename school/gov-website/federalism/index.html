                Federalism is the idea of a mixed government where states, or other regions, govern along side the central, or federal, government.

            <p>
                The United States has three layers of government, local, state, and federal.<br>
                The local government's job is to run schools, transportation, build houses, and more.<br>
                The state government's job is to build and maintain roads, take part in legislative, executive, and judicial activities, etc.<br>
                The federal government's job is to administer foreign policies, make and remove laws, defend the nation, and much, much more.<br>
                <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> If government power wasn't split up, we would have another <a href="../articles-of-confederation/">articles of confederation</a> where states are fighting for power, while the government can't do anything.
